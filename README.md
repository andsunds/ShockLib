# ShockLib
A library of programs surrounding the semi-analytical shocks developed here at the plasma theory group, Chalmers University of Technology.

The Matlab library contains, among others, two packages: Shock_pkg and Shock_pkg_old.   
These packages contain the differnent Shock classes used to calculate a shock. The old package is no longer maintained and not recommended.   
NOTE that there have been a name change from the previous shock repository. The names have changes as:
```
+Shock_pgk/     => +Shock_pkg_old/   
+Shock_pgk_new/ => +Shock_pkg/
```
